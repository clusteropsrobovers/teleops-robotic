# 🤖 TeleOps Robotic – Remote Robot Control Framework
TeleOps Robotic is an open-source, full-stack framework that enables real-time remote control, monitoring, and data streaming for robots. Designed for field robotics, research, and industrial applications, it supports both manual and semi-autonomous operations across networks.

Built to integrate easily with robotic platforms like Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson, or ROS-enabled systems, it helps developers build robust teleoperation systems with minimal setup.

# 🚀 Key Features
- 🎮 Real-Time Teleoperation – Control via web UI, joystick, or keyboard
- 📡 Network-Optimized Communication – Low-latency control using WebSockets, ROS Bridge, or MQTT
- 🎥 Live Video Streaming – WebRTC, MJPEG, or RTSP feeds
- 📊 Telemetry Dashboard – Display sensor data (IMU, GPS, battery, etc.)
- 🧠 Modular Design – Easily extendable for new robot types and control protocols
- 🔐 Secure Channels – Optional HTTPS, token-based auth, and VPN support
